# Acoustic Society International Student Challenge Problem 2023
I worked with a team of 4 other students to take on the Acoustic Society 2023 Challenge Problem
The goal was to extract acoustic sensor data from 3 hydrophones.
We were to use this data to estimate, a diver's breath rate, swimming speed, altitude, and the distance between each hydrophone.
